# Random node js stuff

Here are some nice things:

* random_number.js - prints a random number
* read_from_file.js - reads the file quotes.txt
* simple_web_server.js - Listens to port 8080 and when somebody surfs to 127.0.0.1:8080, it responds with "Hello World"

First install node js. Here are some links for how to install on windows:

*  [Guru99.com](https://www.guru99.com/download-install-node-js.html)
* [Treehouse](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html)


Then run it like this:

```bash
nodejs random_number.js
```

Whouldn't it be nice if instead simple_web_server.js would respond with "Quote of the day: Hello..." or something like that?
